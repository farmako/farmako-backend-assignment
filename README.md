# Backend Assignment

Implement a chat application in **Vanilla Node JS using SSE (Server sent events)**

> Note that you can only use the modules from the Node standard library and that's it. You are not allowed to even have a node_modules folder inside the project.

**A sample client is provided for a minimal Chat UI**

## Objectives

Here are the things that the application should do

- Serving the frontend html file to the browser
- Ability to have multiple chat rooms
- Ability to broadcast messages to a particular chatroom the user is connected to
- Users can be anonymous - no need for authentication (Just to keep it simple)
- Online Presence (Counter of active clients)
- Chat history - if a user joins a room they should be able to see the chat history.
